	<h1>OBSERVATION: I'm very easily annoyed by little things at work.</h1>
	<p>
		

		Two buckets:

		<h2>Death by a Thousand Little Asks</h2>

		While working with my colleagues, sometimes tiny little bits of work are dumped onto me.

		Examples:
		<ul>
			<li>Someone asks me a question</li>
			<li>Someone wants me to do something for them (geez, management)</li>
		</ul>

		This happens because I need to improve at handling stress.

		How do I deal with it?

		<h2>Some people just irk me</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Mr./Mrs. Full of Shit</li>
			<li>The negative nanny</li>
		</ul>
		Why do I feel this way? Does what they say make me feel threatened deep down inside?

		How do I work with these people?
